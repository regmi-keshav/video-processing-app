1
00:00:02,391 --> 00:00:14,575
Popeye the Sailor

2
00:00:17,658 --> 00:00:23,177
Popeye for President

3
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:28,455
And don't forget folks,
when you goes to the polls today

4
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:33,442
a vote for Popeye means free ice cream
for all the kiddies!

5
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:36,298
[applause from the crowd]

6
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:41,968
All right men. Step right over here
and get your free cigars!

7
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:48,342
[applause from the crowd]

8
00:00:48,377 --> 00:00:53,656
And what we needs is bigger elephants
in all our zoos!

9
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:56,070
Oh my gosh!

10
00:00:56,793 --> 00:01:01,015
Now just remember your old pal Bluto
at the polls today fellers,

11
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,880
and there's an extra cigar for each
and every vote you give me, yes sir!

12
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:13,857
And furthermore, I promises two cans
of spinach for every pot.

13
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:17,778
Here's me past record folks,
which speaks for itself.

14
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:19,618
You double crosser!

15
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:21,358
Steal my voters, will you?

16
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,615
[roar from the crowd]

17
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:54,656
I'm getting that winning vote!

18
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:07,766
I guess I'll do over the White House
in canary with green trim.

19
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,465
Gets off the road son,
you're blocking traffic. [laughs]

20
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:26,518
Oh dear. I'll never finish my chores.

21
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:33,309
Miss Oyl, I'd likes you to votes
for me for President.

22
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:36,746
If you wants a good looking guy
in the White House, vote for me babe.

23
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:42,267
I can't go to the polls 'til I get the wood
all chopped for the winter.

24
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:45,458
No sooner said than chopped, Olive.

25
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:50,092
That vote is mine!

26
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:02,919
Timber!!!

27
00:03:18,903 --> 00:03:20,104
Now will you votes for me?

28
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,200
Well, the field still needs plowing.

29
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,294
Okay, Olive!

30
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,518
Plowing's all done.

31
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:57,107
Now to the polls!

32
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:59,362
Oh, I almost forgot!

33
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:02,202
That hay must be put in the hayloft.

34
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,668
The chores are all finished, Olive.
Shall we gos the polls?

35
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:37,599
Popeye, I'm casting my vote for you!

36
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:55,545
Let's go, toots. You're voting for me.

37
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:57,952
You! I'm not voting for.

38
00:04:58,414 --> 00:05:01,026
Oh yes you are.

39
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,805
I'll never, never, never, never, ever vote
for you!

40
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:32,294
Get in there babe and vote for ... Popeye!

41
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:34,117

42
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:01,771
Oh Gosh!
